Install knife ec2 plugin on workstation

The knife ec2 is used to manage API-driven cloud servers that are hosted by Amazon EC2. Chef Knife plugin for EC2 gives knife the ability to create, bootstrap, and manage EC2 instances.

To install the knife ec2 plugin using RubyGems, we want to run the following command:

$ sudo apt-get install make g++ $ sudo apt-get install libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev $ sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev $ sudo /opt/chef/embedded/bin/gem install knife-ec2

Uploading cookbooks

On the workstation, create the required cookbooks and upload to the Chef Server. $ cd ~/chef-repo/cookbooks/

Upload the cookbooks to the server:

$ knife cookbook upload java apt $ knife cookbook upload chef-sugar

Create a Role Using JSON

We can use to configure roles is JSON.

A role is a way to define certain patterns and processes that exist across nodes in an organization as belonging to a single job function. Each role consists of zero (or more) attributes and a run-list. Each node can have zero (or more) roles assigned to it. When a role is run against a node, the configuration details of that node are compared against the attributes of the role, and then the contents of that role's run-list are applied to the node's configuration details. When a chef-client runs, it merges its own attributes and run-lists with those contained within each assigned role.

We will create a role named "my_app", enter:

export EDITOR=$(which vi) $ knife role create my_app

Then, at the knife role create command, editing window will be opened.

In the editor, fill the file contents in JSON format as below: { "name": "my_app", "description": "", "json_class": "Chef::Role", "default_attributes": {

}, "override_attributes": {

}, "chef_type": "role", "run_list": ["recipe[apt]", "recipe[tomcat]"], "env_run_lists": {

} }

After finishing edit, we get:

Created role[my_app]

bootstrap an EC2 instance

Now we are all set to bootstrap an EC2 instance with the my_app role with the following command:

$sudo knife ec2 server create -I ami-9eaa1cf6 -r "role[my_app]" -Z us-east-1c -g Chef11_Server_On_EC2_Security_Group --ssh-key Chef_11_Server -i Chef_11_Server.pem -f t2.micro -A 'AK' -K "bm" --region us-east-1 --ssh-user ubuntu
